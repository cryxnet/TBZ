## Welcome my collection of notes for TBZ
This repository serves as my personal collection of exercises, assignments, notes, and more, all stored in a Markdown editor named Obsidian. The files in this repository are organized by subject and date to help me keep track of my progress and easily find what I need. Everything gets transformed into a static html via a pipeline.

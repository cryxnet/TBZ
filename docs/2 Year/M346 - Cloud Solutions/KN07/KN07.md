## A) Kostenrechnung erstellen

### 1) Rehosting

#### Azure

- **Web Server:** I choose for the web server the VM Type A1 v2 with 1 Core, 2 GB Ram and 10 GB storage. Azure does not provide a VM Type with 1 Core, 2 GB Ram and 20 GB Storage. A web server general doesn't need a lot of storage so I don't see any problems.
- **DB Server:** I choose for the db server the VM Type D2lds V5 with 2 Cores, 4GB 75 GB storage and an extra 32 GB Disk. Azure doesn't provide a VM Type like the exact requirements. But because we need to store a lot of data it makes more sense here to buy an extra disk so we have 108GB storage.
- **1 Backup:** I have one Azure Backup product that backups a VM with 10 GB (for the web server) with the backup policy configs: 7days, 4W, 3M, 0Y.
- **2 Backup:** I have a second Azure Backup product that backups a VM with 100GB (for db server) with the same backup policy as the 1 Backup.
- **Load Balancer:** I also added a load Balancer. It's free in Azure.

#### AWS

- **Web Server:** I choose a EC2 Server type t3.small with 1 core, 2 GB Ram and added 20GB EBS Storage.
- **DB Server:** I choose a EC2 Server type t3a.medium with 2 cores, 4GB Ram and 100 GB EBS Storage.
- **1 Backup:** I choose a AWS Backup product that backups my 20 GB (web server) EBS Storage, backup policy same as azure.
- **2 Backup:** I choose a AWS Backup product that backups my 100 GB (db server) EBS storage, backup policy same as azure.
- **Load Balancer:** I have 1 Application Load Balancer with the Load Balancer Capacity Units (LCUs) calculation of 1GB/hour that enables 3'000 active connections. It costs.

As you can see Amazon takes (with upfront and monthly costs) 1202,68 USD per year.
Azure costs 1.537,8 USD per year. 
When comparing the costs between Amazon and Azure, it is worth noting that even though Amazon may seem less expensive initially, Azure offers better value for your investment. Our calculations show that despite Azure costing $335.12 more annually than Amazon, the return on investment with Azure services and features is significant. Besides, Azure's pricing model ensures you only pay for what you use, making it ideal for businesses of any size with its scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### 2) Replatforming

- For the web server, we can use the "Performance-M" dyno plan. 50$/month
    
-   For the database server, you can use the "Standard 0" plan. It only has 64GB storage but we can scale it later on (its a lot cheaper). 50$/month.

-   For the load balancer, you can use the Heroku add-on called "heroku-load-balancer" which costs $50 per month (server cost).
    
-   For the backup storage, you can use the Heroku add-on called "Heroku Postgres Backups," which costs $10 per month.

In total, the estimated cost for using Heroku with the updated specifications would be $260 per month.

## 3) Repurchasing

#### Zoho

#### Saleforce

- I would pick ZOHO CMS Enterprise Edition because its a lot cheaper (only 40$/user/month) then from saleforce (150usd/user/month). ZOHO CMS also brings more features.

## Conclusion
- I would pick IaaS Solution (Azure) because its cheaper then replatforming and repurchasing. It also brings more freedom because you manage the server etc. If you wan't to expand it and intergrate other services to it, IaaS would be easier and better.
